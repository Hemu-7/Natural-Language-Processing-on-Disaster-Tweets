# Natural-Language-Processing-on-Disaster-Tweets
This project is part of the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets." The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which are not.

## Project Overview
This project uses a dataset of tweets to classify them as disaster-related or not. The objective is to leverage NLP techniques and machine learning models to achieve high accuracy in predicting disaster-related tweets.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following:

Train.csv: Includes the training data with labeled tweets.
Test.csv: Contains the test data without labels.
